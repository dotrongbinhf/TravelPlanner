"""
Placeholder for future LangGraph multi-agent implementation.

This module will contain the agent-based workflow using LangGraph.
For now, it serves as a structural placeholder.

Future implementation will include:
- Agent state management
- Graph workflow definition
- Multiple specialized agents:
  - Planner Agent: Route planning and itinerary creation
  - Coordinator Agent: Workflow orchestration
  - Integration Agent: Communication with .NET API
  - Response Agent: Formatting and structuring responses
- Message passing between agents
- Conditional routing based on context
